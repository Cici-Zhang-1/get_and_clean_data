# get_and_clean_data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

# Project contains several files

## run_analysis.R

This code complete the following steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## merge_data.txt

merge_data.txt stored the 4th step data which contains the test and train data together.

## tidy.txt

tidy.txt stored the tidy data which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
